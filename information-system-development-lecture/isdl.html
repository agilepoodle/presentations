# What is software about?

???

### This presentation tries to describe how I see the SW world
### I try to describe the things I think are important in all size SW systems
### 24+ years of experience squeezed into 1,5 hours

class: center, middle, title, people

# People

???

### At least 50% about people
### Cross-functionality, different skill sets, location, time zones, business, design, code, infrastructure, abilities and limitations...
### Users, customers, business owners, developers etc.
### Large projects, large amount of people, communication paths grow exponentially
### Communication issues, Wiio's laws
#### https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiio%27s_laws
#### Communication usually fails, except by accident.
#### If communication can fail, it will.
### When communication fails, you build the wrong thing! Larger losses with large systems
### What should you do? Who benefits? Why? We need these answers!
### Software is consumed by humans and other software systems
### Value of software is for humans, usually
### Programming is a technical aspect, nuance, nuisance?
### People create SW, so we need Purpose, Autonomy, Mastery (Daniel Pink)

class: center, title, middle, problem

# Software is Problem solving

???

### You need to understand the problem and domain first. Why we need SW? What is the value?
### Not just programming! Interactions, systems of systems
### Cascade of effects, ripple effects
### Large projects just have more problems to solve, larger domains etc.
### How to solve? One problem at a time.
### How to solve complexity?
* Domain-Driven Design, Eric Evans - https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321125215/domainlanguag-20
* Especially Bounded Contexts - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html
* Focus on core models (contexts), base complex design on models, match domain experts /w programmers, ubiquitos language within bounded contexts!
* Bound contexts - make them communicate
* Solution oriented!
* Best software is not written

class: center, title, middle, simple

# Simple is not easy.

???

### Google for Lego manufacturing process! Material quality, precision injection molding, high automation
### No over-engineering, use the most simple solution available
### Do not make it more complex than needed "just in case", you won't need it in the future
### "Easy for you" does not equal "good for the system"
### Simple architecture is extendable and modifiable
### Simplicity is relative! What is easy for me might not be easy for you!
### Always prioritize simplicity over complexity

# "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But itâ€™s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains." - Steve Jobs

class: center, title, middle, complexity

# Avoid complexity
## Embrace simplicity

???

### Added complexity sneaks in!
### Long projects tend to increase complexity
### Do absolute minimum that suffices
### YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It!
### Added complexity accrues cost!
### Rich Hickey - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0
### Complex is hard to change
### Simplicity is a pre-requisite for reliability - Edsger W. Dijkstra
### Intertwined things must be cosidered together - We can consider only a few things at the same time - simple things fit into your brain at once
### You can select only few -ilities; scalability, flexibility, upgradeability, interoperability, transactionality, auditability, usability, portability, reliability, availability etc

class: center, middle, title, validate

# Validate your hypothesis

???

### SW is often written based on business ideas, guessing or forecasting
### Don't write software in vain!
### Validate your business/feature idea before you start -> Why is this feature/addition/system needed?
### If it is not needed, don't do it! 
### Good methods: Biz model canvas, value proposition canvas, value stream mapping etc., A/B testing, user studies, questionnaires etc.
### Service design - design sprints
### Deliver to production!
### What is the best way to validate software you made? -> delivery to real users
### No software survives the first contact with the user

---

class: center, middle, title, stream

# Value Stream
# Cycle/Lead time

???

### Small batch size! -> Quick validation, forecasting
### Concentrate on value, remove waste - especially in large projects
### Question everything, is it really needed?
### Measure the time from an idea to production (whatever production means) - Make it shorter!
### Allows you to change direction quickly
### Software has 4 types of value: 
* create new value
* maintain existing value
* prevent value loss
* recover from value loss

# The Only reliable metric is _

---

class: center, middle, title, computer

# The Only reliable metric is delivered software

???

### Metrics in software: When we are ready? When the product is ready? Quality? 
### Use history to forecast into the future
### Delivery early, deliver often
### Delivered software creates a validation loop!
### If it is not delivered, it's inventory
### Real life usage can be used to validate the product
### Deliver to test env if prod not possible!
### Practice delivery!
### Ephemereal metrics! Objectives, Decision, Information, Metrics

class: center, title, middle, money

# Total cost of ownership

???

### Pareto principle, the 20/80 rule, 20% of features bring 80% of value
### Affects decisions during development
### Short-lived product vs long-lived
### All decisions must be done with TCO in mind!
* maintenance (technology selections, environments)
* operation costs
* availability of skilled workers
* new feature development
* change requests
* etc. 

### Maintenance, future developers
### No esoteric technologies without a good case, select the correct tool for the job

---

class: center, middle, title, fortress

# Reliability
# Robustness
# Security

???

### Extra care needed with large systems
### Can prevent usage
### Must be included in design and architecture from early on
### Cannot be attached 'after the fact' - or very costly
### Anti-fragile software
### capabilities to scale

---

class: center, middle, title, capacity

# Capacity

???

### What can be done with your current organization?
### WIP limits, avoid multitasking
### Hard prioritization
### Explicit work backlog
### Coordination efforts - back to communication
### Helps predicting/forecasting - don't give estimates!
### Overloading developers creates stress


---

class: center, middle, title, practice

# Practices
## Architecture decision log
## Test code is production code
## Pairing (mob programming)
## Team alignment

???

### Treat tests as production code (maintenance)
### Business has value -> code is waste -> tests are toxic waste
### Best software is software that is not written
### Pairing: problems solving, learning, mentoring, sharing knowledge
### Same overall direction for everyone
### No silos (quality, design, security)
### Teams of teams for coordination - back to communication
### Bounded contexts
* isolate domains if possible
* use ubiquitous language
* anti-corruptiom with interfaces

### Public backward compatible API's as means of integration
