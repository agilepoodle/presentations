# Large Software Systems

The presentation material as used on the lecture.

## How to get the material?

I have gathered most of presentations into this github repository. You can either

* copy just the single html-file and the asset -directory here as such to your computer

or

*  [`git clone`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) thw whole repository and operate from there.

## How do I see the presentation?

1. Open your browser
2. Open the html-file you downloaded/cloned
3. Presentation should be now present in your browser

*Protip* Pressing the letter `P` on your keyboard displays the presenter version. Pressing `Shift-?` displays keyboard shortcuts.
