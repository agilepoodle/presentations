# Change the connotation!

## Empower & embrace failure!

## The word Failure  has negative baggage
## Powerful, blaming word
## Failures are not a measure of self-worth

## See it in positive light!
## Teach also others to see failure in different light
## This requires courage and determination
## Which is hard in a success-oriented environment
